##  **Technical Highlights**
1. **DOM Manipulation**: The game shows the DOM to display player turns, the game board, and win/draw messages.
2. **Responsive Layout**: Uses CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout design.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - `index.html` for structure.
   - `style.css` for styling.
   - `app.js` for game logic.
   - `data.js` for win condition patterns.
4. **Deployed Online**: https://imposterplant.github.io/tic-tac-toe/
